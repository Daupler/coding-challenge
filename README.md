## Challenge Two. Single Page Application

### Requirements:

- Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map. Data can be found here: https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat

- Use a Single Page Application, using React or Angular.

- Must have a method to switch between map and a table view listing the food trucks

- The product owners could not agree on a design, but maybe something like this:

![Food Trucks](food-trucks.png)

### Hints:

To make things easier, feel free to rearrange the json output, store locally, or just grab all the data from https://data.sfgov.org/resource/rqzj-sfat.json and parse locally. We are looking for general coding style, creativity, and problem solving. We realize in the real world the API would be more flexible and helpful for the task at hand.

When you are done, please send us your code. You are welcome to send us a zipped folder or share it using Github.
